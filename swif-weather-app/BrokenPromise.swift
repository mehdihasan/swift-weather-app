/**
 *
 * This returns a new generic Promise, which is the primary class provided by PromiseKit. Its constructor takes a simple execution block with one parameter, seal, which supports one of three possible outcomes:
 * seal.fulfill: Fulfill the promise when the desired value is ready.
 * seal.reject: Reject the promise with an error, if one occurred.
 * seal.resolve: Resolve the promise with either an error or a value. In a way, `fulfill` and `reject` are prettified helpers around `resolve`.
